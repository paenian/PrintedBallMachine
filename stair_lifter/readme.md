#Stair Lifter!

A marble machine module that uses a stair-step mechanism on a cam.  The actual lifter consists of three parts:
* sl_inlet.stl - The back set of stairs, doubles as the outlet.  Recommended print in PLA
* sl_stairs.stl - The front, moving set of stairs - rides up and down on the cam.  Again, recommend PLA for easy sliding.
* sl_cam.stl - Oval to lift and lower the stairs - attaches to the motor which is mounted on the sl_inlet.

The module is finished off with a wide slope to drop the ball bearings back down:
* wide_slope.stl

## Assembly
To complete the assembly, you'll need a bunch of printed pegs, feet, and one finishing style.

### Finishing
* Straight Clamps - connect to module left and right
* Dowel Returns - recirculate balls back to ourselves
* 180 degree - link two modules
* 90 degree - turn the corner
