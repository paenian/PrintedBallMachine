# PrintedBallMachine
A 3d Printed ball machine, hung on pegboard.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate the specifications of a printed ball machine, composed of interchangeable modules.

Therefore, the biggest component is the ruleset.

The inlet hopper is given as a standalone STL, for use with other graphics programs, as well as the outlets.

Marbles are 5/8" steel ball bearings.  Steel is heavy.

Inlets align on the 1" marks, outlets on the 1/2"; your machine may raise or lower marbles by any 1" increment.  The centerline for all inlets and outlets is 1" from the start of the hanger.

The easiest module is the simple slope, which is included.  I'll be working on a lifter or two next, and will continue to add modules.
